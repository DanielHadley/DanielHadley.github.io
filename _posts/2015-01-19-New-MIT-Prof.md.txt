title: How a New MIT Professor Spent His Year
---

Last year, my friend pulled 34 all-nighters, began a new job at MIT, surfed 37 days, swam 62, helped to raise two kids, did 12,920 push ups, worked a total of 3,008 hours, and tracked it all in a spreadsheet. He averaged 8.2 hours of work per day, including weekends and holidays. As this heatmap shows, though, his hours varied a lot compared to us regular nine-to-fivers:

It's interesting to read this chart both left to right, as an indicator of what weekdays he works hardest, and top to bottom, to see the days when he would push hard against a deadline and then give himself some time off to surf. 

Perhaps other academics will understand this, but I was surprised by how much work seemed to go into conferences. My friend's longest weeks were when he was preparing to give a talk:

Fortunately, he also found time to go camping and relax a bit between finishing his PhD and starting his job. Nonetheless, 'summer break' included a fair amount of research and reading. And when he started teaching in the fall, things really picked up (despite the fact that he received a job offer with a relatively light teaching load). Contrary to what I assumed, there also seemed to be a lot of administrative meetings, committees, and other miscellaneous tasks, which he filed under 'service'.

Naturally my friend did his own analysis before giving the data to me. In the comments to code he used to create a linear model, I found this gem:

## interesting -- no evidence that big weeks tire me out.  Seems that low hour weeks are random
## but big weeks are associated with big weeks following them.

Sometimes I worry I will lose my surf buddy to the all-nighters. But it may be too early to know, because as one of his other friends pointed out, "too much observational data, not enough experimentation."
