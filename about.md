I am the Chief of Staff to Mayor Joe Curtatone of Somerville, Massachusetts. (*DISCLAIMER: I don't speak for the Mayor or the City on this blog. These are my opinions.*) Previously I was the director of the Mayor's Office of Innovation and Analytics. Prior to that I studied planning, real estate, and statistics at Harvard, where I earned a Master of Urban Planning. 

### About Somerville

Mayor Curtatone is a great boss. He transformed the city from 'Slumerville' to "[The Best Run City in the State](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/05/14/the_model_city/)." We were listed as one of the most [innovative cities in the Country](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/10/07/the-most-influential-cities-in-the-country-according-to-mayors/) in a national survey of mayors, and our happiness survey was featured on the [front page](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/us/01happiness.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) of the New York Times. 

But the real reason I love working here is the chance to make an immediate difference in people's lives by crafting intelligent, data-driven policies.
