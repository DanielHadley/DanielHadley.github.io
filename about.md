I am the Chief of Staff to Mayor Joe Curtatone of Somerville, Massachusetts. (*DISCLAIMER: I don't speak for the Mayor or the City on this blog. These are my opinions.*) Previously I was the director of the Mayor's Office of Innovation and Analytics. Prior to that I studied urban planning at Harvard. 

### About Somerville

Mayor Curtatone is a great boss. He transformed the city from 'Slumerville' to "[The Best Run City in the State](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/05/14/the_model_city/)." We were listed as one of the most [innovative cities in the Country](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/10/07/the-most-influential-cities-in-the-country-according-to-mayors/) in a national survey of mayors, and our happiness survey was featured on the [front page](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/us/01happiness.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) of the New York Times. 

But the real reason I love working here is the chance to make an immediate difference in people's lives by crafting intelligent, data-driven policies.

## Proficiency 

My focus is using data to create intelligent public policy. I enjoy writing code, and consider myself advanced in R, with a passable knowledge of Python, Git, Bash (Linux), HTML, CSS, and Markdown. Many of my favorite projects involve machine learning and statistical modeling. My training in planning also included courses in economics, GIS, transit-oriented development (TOD), and design, all of which I use frequently on the job. 

On the management side, I have overseen teams of highly technical analysts, department heads, and even public works crews. I often engage with the public, journalists, developers (both real estate and software), and academics.
