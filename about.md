I am a Data Scientist at the [Sorenson Impact Center](http://eccles.utah.edu/sorenson-impact-center/), an applied academic institution that is part of the University of Utah’s Business School. My job is to help governments, non-profits, and philanthropists use data to better address difficult social problems. (*DISCLAIMER: I don't speak for the Center or any of its affiliates on this blog. These are my opinions.*)

Previously, I served as the Chief of Staff and Chief Data Scientist to Mayor Joe Curtatone of [Somerville, Massachusetts](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/05/14/the_model_city/), and as an Innovations in American Government Fellow with the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center.

## Proficiency 

My focus is using data to create intelligent public policy. I enjoy writing code, and consider myself advanced in R, with a passable knowledge of Python, Git, Bash (Linux), HTML, CSS, and Markdown. Many of my favorite projects involve machine learning and statistical modeling. My training in planning also included courses in economics, GIS, transit-oriented development (TOD), and design, all of which I use frequently on the job. 

On the management side, I have overseen teams of highly technical analysts, department heads, and even public works crews. I often engage with the public, journalists, developers (both real estate and software), and academics.
