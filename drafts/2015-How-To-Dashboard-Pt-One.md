title: How I Am Building a Data Dashboard in R and Javascript, Part 1: Pipelines

Ideally, I would have had all of the data I needed sitting on a single server, ready for me to crunch on command. In practice, most local governments (including Somerville) use dozens of different vendors, few of whom employ simple APIs.
