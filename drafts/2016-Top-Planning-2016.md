As I did last year, I went through several of my favorite sites and curated what I consider to be the best writing on urban issues from 2015. One thing I love about planning and that drew me to the profession in the first place is that encompasses many skills and areas of interest. I think that diversity if reflected in this year's list. *Caveat emptor*: I use the term planning loosely. Some of these are more inspirational than germane.
