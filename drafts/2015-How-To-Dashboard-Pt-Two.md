R has been the perfect language for the back end of [this](http://www.somervillema.gov/dashboard/daily.html) government data dashboard I am developing. It has excellent packages to pipe in data from every significant source; and of course it facilitated the data munging and statistical analysis. 

The reason I am writing this tutorial is to outline a method other than the more common approach of using Shiny Dashboard.
