title: Recruiting Top Technical Talent to Government 
---

I have a salary line with $45,000, a backlog of analytical work going back to the Great Depression, and a dated position advertisement that begins by shouting "PERSONNEL SYSTEM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY." Sound familiar? If so, you may be a government manager like me, trying to compete with the top consulting firms, start-ups, tech giants, and universitiess to hire new technical staff. 

Despite the competition, I have been fortunate in Somerville to recruit amazing talent with advanced degrees from MIT, Brandeis, Harvard, and Michigan, to name a few. We currently have two analysts with PhDs, and a broad skill-set among staff members. In my experience, recruiting is the most important part of running a city. It's the only way to avoid micromanaging policies and programs.    

## Advertising
For fun, I recently sampled a few dozen advertisements on sites like governmentjobs.com to see how they compare with recruiting websites from the private sector.
